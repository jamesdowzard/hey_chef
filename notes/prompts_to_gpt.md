i want to create an app just using python and vscode for now, which i can talk to through my macbooks microphone or my headphones via bluetooth to my macbook? i want to be able to give the app a recipe from my notion or a webpage, and it feeds it to a large lagnuage model through api like gpt4o or gemini. i want ito be able to trigger the application by saying a key phrase like "hey chef", then ask my question like "ok i want to start making the hearty bean soup. tell me what ingredients i need". then app then converts my speech to text, sends that plus the recipe via api to an llm, gets a response, then uses text to speech to reply to me via microphone or through my headphones via the mac to tell me the answer. do you know of any github repos or apps or similar that already do this sort of thing? if not, can you lay out an approach for how to go about it, and maybe some sample code or packages to handles the sppech to text etc.

i didn't get the params file witht he download, is that a problem?

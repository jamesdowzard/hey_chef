  ## 🥄 Instructions

  ### 1. (Optional) Brine

  - Submerge chicken and refrigerate for 6–12 hours.
  - Rinse and pat dry thoroughly before seasoning.

  ### 2. Seasoning

  - Rub chicken all over (and under the skin where possible) with olive oil or butter.
  - Sprinkle seasoning blend evenly over the chicken:
      - Salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, herbs, and lemon zest.

  ### 3. Preheat Weber Q

  - Place chicken **skin-side up** on the trivet.
  - Roast with lid closed for **~1 hour**, or until the thickest part of the thigh reaches **75°C (165°F)**.
  - You can baste once or twice with pan juices or a little melted butter, but it’s not essential.

  - Remove from heat and **rest for 10–15 minutes**, loosely tented with foil.
  - Carve and serve with your sides.

  ## 🔁 Notes

  - **Butterflied chicken** cooks more evenly and faster than whole, giving you crispier skin and juicier meat.
  - **No need to stuff** the cavity — instead, focus on rubbing seasoning under the skin for max flavour.
  - Optional: Add a few **lemon wedges or garlic cloves** under the chicken on the tray for aroma.
